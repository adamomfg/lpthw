# print statement, followed by a Boolean statement of a math thing
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2

# print statement, followed by a Boolean statement of ANOTHER  math thing
# These thingies are printing True or False, depending on whether the
# preceeding statement was True or False

# five is bigger than minus 2 (ask climent about Celcius) so this will be True
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
# this will be False, as 5 is to the right of -2, like Newt Gingrich
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
